## üí≠ Abstract:
This project aims to create an Affirmations and Mantras app to help users reinforce their self-worth and engage in mindfulness practices. The app will enable users to access positive affirmations and repetitive mantras, fostering a sense of self-empowerment and mindfulness to care for themselves mentally and emotionally. Users also can add their favorite affirmations or mantra. 

The problem this application solves is the lack of a centralized and accessible platform for users to remind themselves of their inherent value and practice mindfulness techniques. In today's fast-paced world, individuals often neglect self-care and struggle with low self-esteem. The app aims to address this issue by providing a tool that promotes self-empowerment and emotional well-being.

## üìù  Context:
This project was completed in Module 1 during week three at the Turing School of Software and Design. A total of 9-10 hours was spent on this project.

##  üé•  Preview of App:

## üîß Installation Instructions:
- Fork this project to your own Github account
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the project
- Read this README thoroughly, then begin working!


## üìö Learning Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

## ü•á Wins

- With improved time management and enhanced skills, I completed the task more efficiently. This allowed me to spend time refactoring and verifying the storage of my pushed message array in the DOM.

- I faced no massive struggles, allowing me to allocate ample time for CSS, HTML, and JS. The last time I completed the second solo project, I overemphasized CSS and HTML in my previous attempt, resulting in missed learning opportunities with JavaScript.

- Integrating accessibility is a strong interest of mine, and I took pride in adding some semantic elements to my HTML. I included the alt attribute to provide image descriptions for users with visual impairments or disabled images. Additionally, I employed elements such as header, main, section, h1, h2, figure, form, label, and input to structure the content meaningfully. These elements aid in conveying the web page's purpose and relationships between different parts, enhancing comprehension for screen readers and search engines.

## üöß Challenges
- When it comes to matching a comp in CSS, I strive for perfection, which often leads me to overcomplicate things. It's both a good and a bad trait because I want to ensure a precise match. However, I recognize the need to improve my time management when it comes to styling.
  
* I've been working on improving my git commits and branches. In my previous solo project, I didn't utilize branches, but I understand their importance in the industry. I wanted to develop the habit of using branches consistently. Although I've made progress, I acknowledge there's room for improvement.
